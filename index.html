    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Through my undergrad, I worked on a number of projects in Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. These projects helped me understand how predictive models actually worke
    and how models learn and train from data.</p><br><br><p>During my second year of undergrad, I came upon a project offered by CLEF Initiative (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum).
    The CLEF Initiative promotes research, innovation, and development by providing an infrastructure for multimodal system testing, model testing, creation of reusable testing models and discussion of results</p>
    <p>The primary objective of the task was to accurately identify the topic from each snippet of a doctor-patient conversation. Given a fixed list of 20 potential topics or section headers (e.g., Assessment,
      Diagnosis, Exam, Medications, Past Medical History), the model was designed to determine which category best matched each snippet. By properly classifying these snippets, the aim was to streamline how clinical
      conversations are organized, making it easier for healthcare professionals and researchers to analyze and review the content.</p><p>In the project, I developed a machine learning pipeline to classify medical
        dialogue snippets into predefined section headers. Using a CSV dataset of doctor-patient conversations, the data was split into training, validation, and test sets. After performing key preprocessing
        steps such as digit and punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and lowercase conversion, a linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model was trained with random oversampling to address class imbalance.
        The model was then validated and used to predict the appropriate section headers on unseen test samples, demonstrating a practical approach for organizing and summarizing clinical notes.</p>
      <p>Three models were developed to predict “Section Headers” from conversation snippets, addressing challenges such as class imbalance and textual complexity:
  </p><h5>1. Linear SVC with Random Oversampling</h5>
    <p>
      This model utilized TF-IDF features to represent text and RandomOverSampler to balance class distributions. A Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was trained for classification.
    </p>
    <h5>2. CART with Logistic Regression</h5>
   <p>
     Combined Classification and Regression Trees (CART) with logistic regression. Preprocessing included lemmatization, label encoding, and CountVectorizer for feature extraction.
   </p>
   <h5>3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h5>
    <p>
      Implemented a deep learning model with an embedding layer for word representation, MaxPooling for dimensionality reduction, and dropout layers to enhance regularization.
    </p>
    <p>
    These models integrated preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and advanced algorithms to optimize predictive performance.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <p>For my Bachelor thesis, I collaborated with The University of Catania under the guidance of Joannes Sam Mertens, Assistant Professor at University of Catania. This project focused on driver behavior profiling and analysis,
    a critical aspect of road safety and security applications. Utilizing data collected from sensors installed in vehicles, the project proposed an approach to create unique driving profiles for each user.
    The research explored the use of deep learning autoencoders, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to learn patterns in driving behavior and detect
    irregularities compared to benchmark models. By analyzing temporal dependencies and unique features, the models assessed similarities and deviations between trained driving profiles and new drivers using
    the same vehicle. The methodology was validated on two datasets: one collected from bike riders in urban settings and another from car drivers on motorways. Experimental results demonstrated the
    effectiveness of the approach in both scenarios, highlighting its potential application in various safety contexts and vehicular environments.
